{"name":"UnitPriceSpecification","properties":{"description":{"description":"A short description of the item.","type":"string"},"priceType":{"description":"A short text or acronym indicating multiple price specifications for the  same offer, e.g. SRP for the suggested retail price or INVOICE for the  invoice price, mostly used in the car industry.","type":"string"},"unitText":{"description":"A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot  provide a standard unit code for unitCode.","type":"string"},"additionalType":{"description":"An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific  types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a  relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa  syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute  - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding  of extra types, in particular those defined externally.","type":"URL"},"alternateName":{"description":"An alias for the item.","type":"string"},"image":{"description":"An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject.","type":"URL"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"description":"Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main  entity being described.

Usage guidelines:     - Use the priceCurrency property (with ISO 4217 codes e.g. \"USD\")     instead of including ambiguous symbols such as '$' in the value.    - Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a     decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.    - Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\"     attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more     human-friendly formatting.    - Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT     NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.","type":"Text"},"eligibleTransactionVolume":{"description":"The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price  specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to  express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the  acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.","type":"PriceSpecification"},"unitCode":{"description":"The unit of measurement given using the UN\/CEFACT Common Code (3  characters) or a URL.
