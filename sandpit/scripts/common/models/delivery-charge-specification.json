Usage guidelines:     - Use the priceCurrency property (with ISO 4217 codes e.g. \"USD\")     instead of including ambiguous symbols such as '$' in the value.    - Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a     decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.    - Note that both RDFa and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\"     attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more     human-friendly formatting.    - Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT     NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.","type":"Text"},"eligibleTransactionVolume":{"description":"The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price  specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to  express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the  acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.","type":"PriceSpecification"},"sameAs":{"description":"URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's  identity.
